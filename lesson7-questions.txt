Questions for Lesson 7

1. What method do you put in the top of a controller so that something happens
before some or all of the controller actions execute?  Where can you put that
change so that it affects all controllers?

before_action method
ApplicationController in current method

2. Consider the following statement:

bin/rails generate model subscription forum:references user:references priority:integer

This creates several files, including two you need to know about.  What are they?
After you do this statement but before starting the rails server, you have to do another
command.  What is that command?

creates app/models/subscription.rb and migration files
bin/rails db:migrate

3. What table is created as a result of the migration described above? What are the column
names in that table? What is the primary key? What are the foreign keys?  What does a 
foreign key do?
table created are subscriptions table
the columns are 
id = the primary key, by default. unique identifier for a records within the tables
user = foreign key, links records between different tables
forum = foreign key, links records between different tables
priority = integer
created_at = automated field
updated_at = automated field

4. You have the following lines in the Subscription model:

belongs_to :user
belongs_to :forum

Because of this, you have several additional methods added to the Subscription class.  This means
that if you have a @subscription (an instance of Subscription), you have a couple of methods
used to refer to associated database methods.  What are those methods?  (Actually there are a few,
but there are two in particular you should know.)

user_id and forum_id
or call the user object @subscription.user

5. You have the following lines in the User model.

has_many :subscriptions
has_many :posts
has_many :forums, through: :subscriptions

What are three important methods that are available to instances of the user model because
of these lines?
@user.subscriptions
@user.posts
@user.forums


6. Suppose that user is an instance of the User class. What kind of object is returned by
user.subcriptions?  Hint: To find out, go into the Rails console for your application.
Then do:

user=User.first
subscriptions = user.subscriptions
subscriptions.class

The second call returns what looks like an empty array -- but it isn't
of the Array class. This is important, because you can do, for 
example:

new_subscription = subscriptions.new

or

new_subscription = user.subscriptions.new

Try that last line.  You will see that it creates a subscription object, but that
object is not entirely empty.  Which attribute is set? Where does it get that
value?
"user_id: 1" is not empty, Current value was setted.
user_id got the value from subscriptions


7. Suppose that user is an instance of User, and forum is an instance of Forum.  What
Active Record Statement could you use to retrieve all the user's posts for that
forum?  Hint: You need to have a where in your statement. Try this out in the console.
You will see the SQL that is executed logged to the screen.  What is that SQL?

SELECT "posts".* FROM "posts" WHERE "posts"."user_id" = ?  [["user_id", 1]]

8. You have the following method in your posts controller:

  def destroy
    @forum = @post.forum
    @post.destroy
    redirect_to @forum, notice: "Your post was deleted."
  end

There is a security exposure, a risk that a hacker could do damage.  What is that
risk? What two things are done in your code to prevent the risk?

It is very easy for someone to bypass the views by sending GET/POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE methods directly to the controller
by using before_action and "strong parameter"

9. The routes for subscriptions are nested under the forum routes.  How does this
change the routes?  What is the additional hash key and value that is passed in the
params hash to the subscriptions controller as a result of this nesting? Which routes
are unaffected by the nesting?

it will generates some routes and creates helper that associated to specific forum
(params[:forum_id])
routes that doesn't affected by the nesting users resources


10. Every action method must do exactly one of two things -- that is, each
method may do all sorts of logic, but at the end, it has to do one of two
things, depending on the outcome of the logic.  What are those two things?

initialize or preparing data for request
rendering the response
